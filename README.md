# Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright Library for .NET
![logo640]

## Description
*Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright is a .NET library for C# that helps you write fast, maintainable, robust and fluent Playwright-driven web tests based on the **co**ntrol/**pa**ge/**ro**ot-**o**bject (Coparoo) pattern.*

## Demo Animation
An animated walkthrough of a minimal multi-page setup (dynamic relationships, interface-based navigation, checkbox + button interactions):

For a detailed walkthrough of this demo, including the complete source code and step-by-step explanations, see [Demo README](Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Demo/README.md).

Here's the basic pattern illustrated in the demo above - notice how naturally the test reads:

    var tab = new DemoTab();                                   // create the browser tab
    await tab.Open();                                          // open the application

    await tab.On<ISettings>().EnableNotifications.Check();     // interact with a checkbox
    await tab.On<ISettings>().EnableAutoSave.Check();          // check another option

    tab.Goto<IPreferences>();                                  // navigate to Preferences page
    await tab.On<IPreferences>().SavePreferences.ClickAsync(); // click a button
    await tab.On<IPreferences>().ExportSettings.ClickAsync();  // click another button

    await tab.Close();                                         // cleanup

The library ships with built-in control wrappers for common HTML elements, making it easy to interact with various UI components. These include `Checkbox`, `Button`, `TextBox`, `DropDown`, `Table`, `RadioButton`, and many more. In the example above, checkboxes are used for the notification and auto-save settings, demonstrating how these controls provide clean, type-safe APIs for interaction without dealing with raw locators or CSS selectors.

## NuGet Package Information
To make it easier for you to develop with the *Trumpf Coparoo Web* library we release it as NuGet packages:

- Controls library: [Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Controls](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Controls)
- Extension helpers: [Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Extensions)

Installation examples (Package Manager Console):
`Install-Package Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright`
`Install-Package Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Controls`
`Install-Package Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Extensions`

## Getting Started
If you want to learn more about the *control/page/root-object pattern*, the idea behind this framework, consider reading [the design pattern introduction](PATTERN.md).
It illustrates how the framework can help you at writing maintainable and fast-running user interface tests.

If you can't wait getting started and want see some code, have a look at [this code example](DEMO.md).

For a richer, multi-page sample illustrating dynamic page object relationships, team decoupling, and interface-based testing, explore the dedicated demo: [Full Demo README](Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Demo/README.md).

Finally, if things are set up and you want to work on user interface tests in a collaborative setup consisting of many possibly independent teams, or write test cases even before the user interfaces ready to execute (say, directly after the UX team is done) consider reading [this tutorial](DECOUPLING.md).
The demo project shows these principles in practice (dynamic ChildOf registration + interface isolation). See: [Demo README](Trumpf.Coparoo.Playwright.Demo/README.md).
